          Like you, I like exploring and learning new things. <br />
          <br />
          That's exactly why I decided to found upTicket - to improve my design,
          programming, and writing skills. And don't get me wrong - they are far
          from perfect and the majority of things you've read above are
          completely made up. <br />
          <br /> The point I wanted to make is to prove that EVERYBODY is able
          to build and create things that can be not only very educating but
          also fun. <br /> <br /> upTicket is not a SaaS business, because it's
          not profitable at all. Nevertheless, it's my biggest programming
          project so far and you can check out the complete code{" "}

          . <br />
          <br /> If you would like to cooperate, feel free to make a pull
          request.
          <br />
          <br /> All the best,
          <br />
          <br /> Michal Bednar
